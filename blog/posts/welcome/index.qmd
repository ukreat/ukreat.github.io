Welcome to the blog of the nephroepidemiology group at the UMC Utrecht! Here, we will share interesting publications (both from our own group and from other researchers), give updates on conferences we attended, and share posts aimed at laymen (written in understandable Dutch).

To kick things off, today, we had our first get together. Although the nephroepidemiology group has existed for a longer time, this was given shape in an informal manner. Today marks the first occurrence of our biweekly recurring meeting. These meetings will serve not only as a short moment to connect with each other, but also to discuss currently ongoing projects, discuss articles, give talks, host external speakers, etc.

...

To finish off, I'll append an R trick to each post (until I run out of tricks)

#### This post's R-trick: multicursor
Did you know you can activate a multicursor in R? This allows you to write the same code on multiple lines simultaneously. Great for if you are writing code in bulk! To activate it, simply hold the Alt/Option key and drag the cursor along the lines that you want the cursor to apply to. On some operating systems, you may need to press the Alt/Option key one more time to activate the cursor. Happy bulk-writing!
