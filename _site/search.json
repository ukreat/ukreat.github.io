Here, we will share interesting publications (both from our own group and from other researchers), give updates on conferences we attended, and share posts aimed at laymen (written in understandable Dutch).\nTo kick things off, today, we had our first get together at the Café Creatinine. Although our group has existed for a longer time, this was given shape in an informal manner. Today marks the first occurrence of our biweekly recurring meeting. These meetings will serve not only as a short moment to connect with each other, but also to discuss currently ongoing projects, discuss articles, give talks, host external speakers, etc.\n…\nTo finish off, I’ll append an R trick to each post (until I run out of tricks)\n\nThis post’s R-trick: multicursor\nDid you know you can activate a multicursor in R? This allows you to write the same code on multiple lines simultaneously. Great for if you are writing code in bulk! To activate it, simply hold the Alt/Option key and drag the cursor along the lines that you want the cursor to apply to. On some operating systems, you may need to press the Alt/Option key one more time to activate the cursor. Happy bulk-writing!\nAn example from Stackoverflow \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

However, these long-term outcomes remain difficult to investigate due to individual heterogeneity in individuals with acute kidney injury, difficulty in defining acute kidney injury, and reliance on smaller datasets. In this research line, we aim to overcome these shortcomings to elucidate the long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury, both through a predicitve lens and a relational lens.\n\nPeople working on this\n\nDeniseRobinRoemer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this line of research, Denise is in the lead. She has written multiple papers on the topic and more analyses are underway. She is responsible for coming up with new avenues within the project, writing papers and performing analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin is the principal investigator in this project.

    "text": "Cardiovascular risk management in CKD\nIndividuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receive a plethora of medications and the majority of treatment regimens can be categorised as polypharmacy. However, for most medications, evidence on effectiveness and safety in the CKD population is limited. Given the altered drug metabolism and shorter life expectancy of these people, it is of paramount importance to reassess safety and effectiveness of medications in them. Witholding or deprescribing ineffective or unsafe treatment can help reduce medication-related disease burden and avoid adverse side effects. As randomised trials are rarely feasible in this population, we approach this using modern epidemiological methods.\n\nPeople working on this\n\nJuliaEllisRoemerRobin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia has performed multiple studies to show the extent of polypharmacy in people with CKD. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, she was able to gave a broad perspective on the burden of polypharmacy and also showed the lack of evidence underlying most drugs contributing to polypharmacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing on the work Julia has done, Ellis is investigating the utilisation of guideline-recommended drugs throughout the hospital. Additionally, she will take the lead on multiple projects investigating the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in individuals with CKD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoemer is working together with Ellis to shape the different studies she is performing, additionally strengthening the projects’ methodology and providing quality checks on the way data is used and analysed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin has long been working on this, being the supervisor of both Julia and Ellis. He ensures the project’s long-term sustainability, gives direction where needed, and connects the team members with the right collaborators."

The combination of multiple trials have shown benefits of HDF over HD, but more research is needed. The mechanism by which HDF improves outcomes remains unclear, as does the heterogeneity in treatment effects across many populations. In this project, we apply data from multiple trials, as well as large global databases to further investigate the benefit of HDF over HD.\n\nPeople working on this\n\nSanneRobinRoemer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanne is combing her clinical knowledge with her research skills to investigate HDF.
