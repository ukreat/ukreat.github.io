[Roemer is a clinical epidemiologist, working on the interplay of nephrology, immunology, and virology in kidney transplantation recipients. He completed his BSc in Medicine and afterwards finished his PhD on causal inference and prediction modelling in people with CKD, at the Leiden University Medical Center (The Netherlands) and Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). Besides his clinical projects, he provides epidemiological and programming support.]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

[Cindy is a medical doctor and clinical epidemiologist, applying her knowledge to the cardiorenal axis. She performed multiple studies on sex differences in peripheral arterial disease and is currently investigating heart failure and its interplay with kidney disease. Her thesis also has a methodological component, with a specific focus on prediction modelling.]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

[*ORCID: [0000-0002-9022-5937](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9022-5937)*]{style="font-size: 90%;"}

[Julia is a PhD student currently finishing her medical studies. Her PhD research focuses on polypharmacy in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Besides elucidating the extent of polypharmacy in this population, she has also studied the lack of evidence for multiple common cardiorenal protective drugs and has further investigated their use in this population.]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

[Denise is a medical doctor whose research focuses on long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury. To get a broad overview, she has performed multiple meta-analyses and clustering studies, and worked on developing prediction models to get personalised insights in these long-term outcomes. Additionally, she has previously done research on the patient perspective in kidney transplantation.]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

[Sanne is a medical doctor, doing her PhD on haemodiafiltration. Not only is she investigating the possible mechanisms through which haemodiafiltraiton improves survival; she is also working to assess the effect of haemodiafiltration in a real-world population and obtain individualised estimates of its effect over haemodialysis. Prior to her PhD, she already obtained experience in dialysis research, studying the effects of incremental dialysis.]{style="font-size: 80%;"}
