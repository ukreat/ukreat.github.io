We have a number of overarching research lines, within which we perform most of our research. Besides these research lines, we also collaborate with other researchers on the broader spectrum of cardio-kidney-metabolic epidemiological research and methodological development and innovation.

## Long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury
Acute kidney injury is an impactful disease that may have long-lasting consequences affecting the cardio-kidney axis. However, these long-term outcomes remain difficult to investigate due to individual heterogeneity in individuals with acute kidney injury, difficulty in defining acute kidney injury, and reliance on smaller datasets. In this research line, we aim to overcome these shortcomings to elucidate the long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury, both through a predicitve lens and a relational lens.

## Cardiovascular risk management in CKD
Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receive a plethora of medications and the majority of treatment regimens can be categorised as polypharmacy. However, for most medications, evidence on effectiveness and safety in the CKD population is limited. Given the altered drug metabolism and shorter life expectancy of these people, it is of paramount importance to reassess safety and effectiveness of medications in them. Witholding or deprescribing ineffective or unsafe treatment can help reduce medication-related disease burden and avoid adverse side effects. As randomised trials are rarely feasible in this population, we approach this using modern epidemiological methods.

## Julia
:::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](headshots/jmtc.jpg){.lightbox width=90%}
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
Julia has performed multiple studies to show the extent of polypharmacy in people with CKD. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, she was able to gave a broad perspective on the burden of polypharmacy and also showed the lack of evidence underlying most drugs contributing to polypharmacy.

## Haemodiafiltration as alternative to haemodialysis
Haemodiafiltration (HDF) is a possible alternative to haemodialysis (HD) that uses both diffusion and convection to improve outcomes of individuals on dialysis. The combination of multiple trials have shown benefits of HDF over HD, but more research is needed. The mechanism by which HDF improves outcomes remains unclear, as does the heterogeneity in treatment effects across many populations. In this project, we apply data from multiple trials, as well as large global databases to further investigate the benefit of HDF over HD.

## Kidney Tx through the lens of nephrology, immunology, and virology
Kidney transplantation is a clinical setting in which many different disciplines are brought together. However, research on kidney transplantation often does not combine all these disciplines. To shed new light on their interplay, we are investigating the long-term post-kidney transplantation phase using multidisciplinary data.
