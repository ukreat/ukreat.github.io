[Hi! Welcome to the homepage of the Utrecht Kidney Research & Epidemiological Analyses Team (U-KREAT); the nephroepidemiology research group of the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht.]{style="font-size: 130%;"}

Our team is diverse in its [background and specialties](team.qmd), but all members share the same mission: improving  clinical care and outcomes for individuals with chronic kidney disease, those on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients, using epidemiological methods and big data.

To this end, we use advanced epidemiological and data scientific methods, applied to a wide range of large and granular data sources, including randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, electronic health records, and registries.

We are located at the UMC Utrecht. Our team is embedded in the Department of Nephrology and Hypertension and in Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD) of the Central Diagnostics Laboratory.

This collaboration gives us access both to direct clinical involvement and to the high-quality research infrastructure of UPOD.
